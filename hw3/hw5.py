   #  the output table, and 3–4 sentences: at what sample size do winners stabilize? Does less data ever win? What does that imply for expensive-to-label SE tasks?

# Interestingly, the highest wins are most often from smaller sample sizes and in this case the sample size is 30. The larger sample sizes do win as well, but there is a pretty steap drop off from 50, 49, 45 to 20, 15, and 13. So, based on this table, and what we have learned in class, less data often wins and is less coss intensive compared to the larger data sets.
